# My Dolls Collection API

This is my simple API project, named "My Dolls Collection". developed as part of the Golang Course by bornToDev.

This API supports 4 basic HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and includes the following features:

1. **GET**: Retrieve a list of all dolls.
2. **GET**: Retrieve detailed information about a doll by its ID.
3. **POST**: Add a new doll to the collection.
4. **PUT**: Update doll data using its ID.
5. **DELETE**: Remove a doll from the collection by its ID (donate doll).
